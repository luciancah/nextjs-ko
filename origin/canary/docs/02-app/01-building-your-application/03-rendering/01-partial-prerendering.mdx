> Partial Prerendering is an **experimental** feature and subject to change.

Partial Prerendering (PPR) is a rendering strategy that combines the benefits of static and dynamic rendering on the same route. With PPR, you can wrap any [dynamic](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) components in a [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) boundary. When a new request comes in, Next.js will immediately serve a static HTML shell from the cache, then render and [stream](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#streaming) the dynamic parts in the same HTTP request.

## Incremental Adoption (Version 15)

In Next.js 15, you can incrementally adopt Partial Prerendering in [layouts](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/layouts-and-templates) and [pages](/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages) by setting the [`ppr`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/ppr) option in `next.config.js` to `incremental`, and exporting the `experimental_ppr` [route config option](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config) at the top of the file:

```js filename="next.config.js"
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: 'incremental',
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" switcher
import { Suspense } from "react"
import { StaticComponent, DynamicComponent, Fallback } from "@/app/ui"

export const experimental_ppr = true

export default function Page() {
  return {
     <>
      <StaticComponent />
      <Suspense fallback={<Fallback />}>
        <DynamicComponent />
      </Suspense>
     </>
  };
}
```

```jsx filename="app/page.js" switcher
import { Suspense } from "react"
import { StaticComponent, DynamicComponent, Fallback } from "@/app/ui"

export const experimental_ppr = true

export default function Page() {
  return {
     <>
      <StaticComponent />
      <Suspense fallback={<Fallback />}>
        <DynamicComponent />
      </Suspense>
     </>
  };
}
```

> **Good to know**:
>
> - Routes that don't have `experimental_ppr` will default to `false` and will not be prerendered using PPR. You need to explicitly opt-in to PPR for each route.
> - `experimental_ppr` will apply to all children of the route segment, including nested layouts and pages. You don't have to add it to every file, only the top segment of a route.
> - To disable PPR for children segments, you can set `experimental_ppr` to `false` in the child segment.

## Enabling PPR (Version 14)

For version 14, you can enable it by adding the [`ppr`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/ppr) option to your `next.config.js` file. This will apply to all routes in your application:

```js filename="next.config.js"
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```
