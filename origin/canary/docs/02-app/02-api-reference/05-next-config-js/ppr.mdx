> Partial Prerendering is an **experimental** feature and subject to change.

Partial Prerendering is an experimental feature that allows static portions of a route to be prerendered and served from the cache with dynamic holes streamed in, all in a single HTTP request.

Incremental support is available in Next.js 15, allowing you to opt-in to Partial Prerendering for specific routes and layouts.

To enable Partial Prerendering, set the experimental `ppr` flag to `incremental`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    ppr: 'incremental',
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

## Options

- `incremental`: Allows you to incrementally opt-in layouts and pages, and should be used with the [`experimental_ppr`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#experimental_ppr) route config option.
- `true`: Enables Partial Prerendering for all routes in your application.

We recommend using `incremental` first. Once all the routes in your application have PPR enabled, it’ll be considered safe for you to set the `ppr` value to `true`, and enable it for the entire app and all future routes.

> **Good to know:**
>
> - When using `incremental`, routes that don't have `experimental_ppr` will default to `false` and will not be prerendered using Partial Prerendering. You need to explicitly opt-in to Partial Prerendering for each route.
> - Partial Prerendering does not yet apply to client-side navigations. We are actively working on this.
> - Partial Prerendering is designed for the [Node.js runtime](/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes) only. Using the Edge Runtime is not needed when you can instantly serve the static shell.
