The `instrumentation.js|ts` file is used to integrate monitoring and logging tools into your application. This allows you to track the performance and behavior of your application, and to debug issues in production.

To use it, place the file in the **root** of your application or inside a [`src` folder](/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory) if using one.

## Config Option

Instrumentation is currently an experimental feature, to use the `instrumentation` file, you must explicitly opt-in by defining [`experimental.instrumentationHook = true;`](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/instrumentationHook) in your `next.config.js`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    instrumentationHook: true,
  },
}
```

## Exports

### `register` (required)

The file exports a `register` function that is called **once** when a new Next.js server instance is initiated. `register` can be an async function.

```ts filename="instrumentation.ts" switcher
import { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'

export function register() {
  registerOTel('next-app')
}
```

```js filename="instrumentation.js" switcher
import { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'

export function register() {
  registerOTel('next-app')
}
```
