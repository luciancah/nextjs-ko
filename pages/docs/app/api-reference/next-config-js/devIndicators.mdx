{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

<AppOnly>

When you edit your code, and Next.js is compiling the application, a compilation indicator appears in the bottom right corner of the page.

> **Good to know**: This indicator is only present in development mode and will not appear when building and running the app in production mode.

In some cases this indicator can be misplaced on your page, for example, when conflicting with a chat launcher. To change its position, open `next.config.js` and set the `buildActivityPosition` in the `devIndicators` object to `bottom-right` (default), `bottom-left`, `top-right` or `top-left`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivityPosition: 'bottom-right',
  },
}
```

In some cases this indicator might not be useful for you. To remove it, open `next.config.js` and disable the `buildActivity` config in `devIndicators` object:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    buildActivity: false,
  },
}
```

There is also an indicator to show whether a page will be prerendered during a build in dev. It can be hidden per-page by clicking although if you never want it to show it can be disabled:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    appIsrStatus: false,
  },
}
```

</AppOnly>

<PagesOnly>

> **Good to know**: This indicator was removed in Next.js version 10.0.1. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of Next.js.

When a page qualifies for [Automatic Static Optimization](/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) we show an indicator to let you know.

This is helpful since automatic static optimization can be very beneficial and knowing immediately in development if the page qualifies can be useful.

In some cases this indicator might not be useful, like when working on electron applications. To remove it open `next.config.js` and disable the `autoPrerender` config in `devIndicators`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  devIndicators: {
    autoPrerender: false,
  },
}
```

</PagesOnly>
